Import the Vuforia plugin and your image database into Unity.
In the Vuforia folder, click and drag the ARCamera prefab into the hierarchy.
Find the imageTarget prefab in the same folder and drag it into the hierarchy as well.
In the scene, move the imageTarget prefab away from the camera
by a few units.
Drag it onto the ARCamera prefab (making it a child).
Using cubes create a 3D copy of the maze on top of the image target.
Make a small sphere and create a new material.
Drag the new material onto the sphere and make it a bright color.
Create a cube and place it above the maze (this is going to be the spawn point for the sphere).
Remove the mesh renderer and collider of the sphere.
Add a C# script to the sphere, call it "ballScript" and paste the code
In the scene view, click the sphere, and on the ball script, drag the plane and the cube into their respective places.
In the hierarchy, drag the plane, the sphere, and the cube on top of the image target to make them children.
Click play and all should be well.
